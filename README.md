# INDIAN-DISTRICT-POPULATION-STATISTICS
Indian district population is a study of how people are spread across different districts in india. through charts, tables, and comparisons, the project gives a clear picture of India’s population patterns across regions

**Objectives of the project**

• to study population distribution across different districts and states in India  
• to analyse male and female population share in each region  
• to understand the literacy variation between states and districts  
• to examine population growth and demographic trends  
• to compare high population and low population regions  
• to identify patterns that affect planning and development  
• to present demographic information using clear visuals in power bi  

**Visuals used**

• bar charts for comparing state and district populations  
• pie charts for male and female population share  
• map visuals for district wise literacy and state comparisons  
• stacked bar charts for literacy and population together  
• line and bar combinations for growth analysis  
• cards showing total population, male population and female population  
• filters and slicers for selecting specific states and districts  

**Dataset Information**

• contains population details of India by state and district  
• includes total population, male population and female population  
• provides literacy percentage for each state and district  
• includes sex ratio and population growth information  
• data is used to create charts and comparisons in power bi  
This project uses a publicly available retail sales dataset, which has been cleaned, modified, and restructured in Excel and Power Query to suit the analysis requirements.  

**key insights**

• Uttar Pradesh shows the highest total population while several north eastern states show smaller population counts  
• male population is slightly higher than female population at the national level  
• literacy levels vary widely across states with Kerala showing a higher literacy share  
• sex ratio differs among regions showing demographic imbalance in some northern states  
• some states show higher population growth when compared to others  
• districts with better literacy tend to show improved social development indicators
